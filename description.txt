Ant Mania
==============

The planet of Hiveum has been infested by giant space ants and you are tasked 
with simulating the invasion.

You are given a map containing the names of colonies on Hiveum. The map is in a
file, with one colony per line. 
The colony name is first,followed by 1-4 directions (north, south, east, or west). 
Each one represents a tunnel to another colony that lies in that direction.

For example:

Fizz north=Buzz west=Bla south=Blub
Buzz south=Fizz west=Blip

The colony and each of the pairs are separated by a single space, and the
directions are separated from their respective colonies with an equals (=) sign.

You should create N ants, where N is specified as a command-line argument.

These ants start out at random places on the map, and wander around randomly,
following links. Each iteration, the ants can travel in any of the directions
leading out of a colony. In our example above, an ant that starts at Fizz can go
north to Buzz, west to Bla, or south to Blub.

When two ants end up in the same place, they fight, and in the process kill
each other and destroy the colony. When a colony is destroyed, it is removed from
the map, and so are any tunnels that lead into or out of it.

In our example above, if Buzz were destroyed the map would now be something
like:

Fizz west=Bla south=Blub

Once a colony is destroyed, ants can no longer travel to or through it. This
may lead to ants getting "trapped".

You should create a program that reads in the world map, creates N ants, and
unleashes them. The program should run until all the ants have been
destroyed, or each ant has moved at least 10,000 times. When two ants
fight, print out a message like:

Fizz has been destroyed by ant 10 and ant 34!

(If you want to give them names, you may, but it is not required.) Once the
program has finished, it should print out whatever is left of the world in the
same format as the input file.

Feel free to make assumptions (for example, that the colony names will never
contain numeric characters), but please add comments or assertions describing
the assumptions you are making.
